.SH NAME
ShallowWaterSolver \- solves depth-integrated wave equations
.SH SYNOPSIS
ShallowWaterSolver [ option(s) ] [ [ session.xml ] ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ShallowWaterSolver
solves depth-integrated wave equations of the shallow water type using the spectral/hp element method. It is built on the
.B Nektar++
high-order spectral/hp element framework.

The
.B ShallowWaterSolver
can solve two types of problems:
.IP \(em 3
Linear SWE in primative variables
.IP \(em 3
Non-linear SWE in conservative variables

.SS Further information
For further details and specific configuration options, please consult the
.B Nektar++ user guide
available from the website \(la www.nektar.info \(ra.

.SH EXAMPLE
To run the solver on a single input file which contains both the geometry and
the solver parameter specifications

.RS
.B ShallowWaterSolver session.xml
.RE

It is often helpful to separate the geometry specification from the remaining
solver parameters. In this case multiple .xml files may be provided
