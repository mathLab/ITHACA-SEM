\chapter{Introduction}
Nektar++ \cite{CaMoCoBoRo15} is a tensor product based finite element package
designed to allow one to construct efficient classical low polynomial order
$h$-type solvers (where $h$ is the size of the finite element) as well as higher
$p$-order piecewise polynomial order solvers.  The framework currently has the
following capabilities:

\begin{itemize}
\item Representation of one, two and three-dimensional fields as a collection of
 piecewise continuous or discontinuous polynomial domains.
\item Segment, plane and volume domains are permissible, as well as domains
 representing curves and surfaces (dimensionally-embedded domains).
\item Hybrid shaped elements, i.e triangles and quadrilaterals or tetrahedra,
prisms and hexahedra.
\item Both hierarchical and nodal expansion bases.
\item Continuous or discontinuous Galerkin operators.
\item Cross platform support for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
\end{itemize}

The framework comes with a number of solvers and also allows one to construct a
variety of new solvers.

Our current goals are to develop:
\begin{itemize}
\item Automatic auto-tuning of optimal operator implementations based upon not
only $h$ and $p$ but also hardware considerations and mesh connectivity.
\item Temporal and spatial adaption.
\item Features enabling evaluation of high-order meshing techniques.
\end{itemize}
