% Utilities Master File

In this part of the developer's guide, we walk you through development aspects of the various utilities that are available within publicly-available \nek repository.
We encourage you to incorporate these utilities into your science and engineering work flows.  If you find that the current utilities do not meet your needs and consequently you end up building
a new utility based upon our framework, we encourage you to consider submitting this to us for incorporation in the publicly-available master branch.
